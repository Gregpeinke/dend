It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination  This game gives you the basic training on how to use the portal gun and to find the introduction of GLaDOS's true colours, or rather AI glitches that makes any threat to human kind.   Great voice acting from Glados and she is what makes the game so great, you hear her throughout the game and her dialog is really funny. Sounds like HAL from Space Odysee. The robots have such cute voices.\nThis is a fascinating puzzle game that i got with the Orange Box, a bundle of random Valve games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2. And guess what, the events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe, something that makes this game much more cooler. Portal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money. And the advantage to this, YOU CAN PLAY PORTAL 2 !  Great game. The mechanic of transportation through teleporting is the best! Wish it existed in real life so that i can get to places much easier and faster.  Wow. But Why are you reading these reviews when it's clear that this is one amazing game that everyone should own? Instabuy NOW!   \n\nAnd if you liked portal, you may also want to try out this other similar game called QUBE","timestamp_created":1403374621,"timestamp_updated":1403374697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.427973300218582153","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10625775","author":{"steamid":"76561198011128587","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1644194741},"language":"english","review":"Loved this game.

It is a \"puzzle-ish\" game for people who like shooters. I liked that it was difficult to die, since it made it easier to focus on finding solutions to the \"puzzles\", but even with easy deaths the hard part about this game isn't figuring out what to do, it is doing it with somewhat fiddly controls (played using an XBOX 360 controller). Still, if the game disappoints on puzzle satisfaction, it really delivers on dry humor. Your handler, GLADOS is very funny and when she sings the credits song you can't help but grin. The graphics are still shiny (some texture mapping looks bad, but doesn't detract too badly) even after 6 years, which is no small feat as games start to age. As others have said, the level of difficulty will probably see you finishing the base game in less than 3 hours, even if you get stuck-a disadvantage since it significantly boosts your $ cost per hour of entertainment. This also hurts a decision to buy because Portal introduced no really new elements to physics puzzlers nor did it do them especially better, it seems to owe its current popularity to previously high reviews (much like Angry Birds).\n\nStill, one of the best measures of a game is whether you'll remember it after you're done, and I have to say I will remember Portal.

Eventually, I came across a sale on Steam that had the Entire Valve package for less than £30.00, which included the Portal Series, so since I had paid for them, I figured I may as well try them and well, I was not disappointed!\n\nI loved the first Portal game, even though it was short, it had everything that I good game should have! Great game-play and a great story, and Portal 2 really improved upon everything that Portal 1 had to offer. There are practically zero faults that I have with this game.\n\nIt just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover and that just because something is popular, doesn't mean you should automatically dismiss it.

It's not a first person shooter like it initially appears to be, it's a first person puzzle game. Don't let the word \"puzzle\" fool you into getting the idea that this is a typical puzzle game though, it's very action packed. The entire game revolves around the concept that there are blue portals, and orange portals, and that objects and people who pass through one portal appear out the other. You use the portals to navigate the stages, alter the paths of moving objects, and to use momentum to \"fling\" yourself around the stages. The game is very short, so you could easily play through it in a single run. Those who want more can play the advanced chambers, which are remastered versions of story chambers that have been modified to be more challenging. If that isn't enough, the game has a surprisingly deep story.
