It places players on both sides, Survivors and Zombies.\nThe same maps but this time survivors facing real zombie players on the other side preventing your success.\n4 survivors vs 4 special zombie units such as Hunters, Boomers, Tanks, Smokers each with a certain ability to stop the survivors progress.

You play as one of the four survivors who have to get from point A to point B, while defending themselves from hordes of 'fast' zombies and search corners for supplies. Or you can play as special infected too, in more competive mode. Don't mind \"Game of the Year Edition\" over the banner, it's just there for coolness, not some complete edition. It did have three \"free DLC\" / big updates that added survival mode, Crash Cource and Sacrifice campaign since it came out.\n\nMultiplayer community is still quiet alive, even though most moved over to Left 4 Dead 2. You will not always find exactly what you want, but you will still find some people playing the game. Aside from Survival mode, that part is empty, everybody was overrun by zombies it seems.\n\nAnd well, it's a pretty great game. It got great setting, with a great atmosphere of always being set at night. With four likable characters. Simple yet deep gameplay. It is simple compared to L4D2, you don't have much choice, variations, in weapons for example. Feels more refined too. Somehow I dig it more. It even has two grenade types, which are actually useful and tactical in this horde based game.\n\nThe best thing about it is AI Director. In other words, it's a system that keeps track of players \"stress level\" and then would change position of items, zombies and other small changes. It's quiet clever in that it both serves as randomizer and also follows general rules of pacing. No, it's quite predictable. Moment of rushing zombies and wandering zombies change around, when it gets quiet that it means that something heavy is coming or that you barely survived previous challenge. And that it doesn't spawn zombies so good, so in Versus modes people just rush forward.\nAnd while it's predictable, the different pacing still makes it much more addictive. The question is not what, but how soon and when.\n\nBut there is one thing which would make it hard to decide if to recommend it or not. All the campaigns ended up being included in L4D2! Not only that, but they were expanded with all the new stuff that L4D2 added. Weapons, special infected types. Not only that, but if you want more original experience, then you can run the mutator that limits content back to L4D1. Though it's a bit uneven. But still.\nThe only different things would be nitpick, like some slight level alternation, or not being able to see your body when moving camera down, or if you hate watching flying gibs from explosion for some reason.\n\nAnd well, most people should just purchase L4D2 instead, as it has all that L4D1 got. The first one still has it's own appeal, to be honest, in small changes. Very small differences. But eh, leave it to purists of sorts. Otherwise, if you are core gamer of sorts, then buy it, It's awesome game by itself.","timestamp_created":1442008808,"timestamp_updated":1442008890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512820541858673096","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17986485","author":{"steamid":"76561198196766917","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":115887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2407,"last_played":1653834401},"language":"turkish","review":"its too excited game. graphics are successfull. its better to play with friends:)","timestamp_created":1441996848,"timestamp_updated":1441996848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538942992687225342","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17975765","author":{"steamid":"76561198146988457","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2959,"last_played":1591504679},"language":"english","review":"Not much of a reason to go back to this one, unless you just want to experience the OG.","timestamp_created":1441925990,"timestamp_updated":1647678152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17972856","author":{"steamid":"76561198060784701","num_games_owned":469,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":8460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6277,"last_played":1658085512},"language":"english","review":"In my opinion this game must be on every profile.

I highly recommend getting up to three other people on board that you can speak to via headset. I say this due to the fact (and you may be surprised how often this occurs) they may not realise that you've been pounced on by a hunter, pulled away by a smoker or thrown up on by a boomer (...thus resulting in being molested by a horde of horny zombies, that want to rip your clothes off) and you will end up typing things like “jyghk!!!11!” in the chat, just to be abandoned, angry, on the ground, bleeding out, shooting wildly into the crowd of gropers around you.\n\nSo in short, get a headset... (And some friends)\n\nAfter getting into the swing of sticking together and (although you may hate it) helping out your teammates, picking them up when they go down and parting with your precious pills to prolong their lives, you will  become a pro. You'll be running the Expert level campaigns, crowning witches, burning tanks, sniping hunters in the face mid jump, generally winning at the game.\n\nVersus is another story... A lot of fun, however it's hard to find a normal server these days, so you'll be thrown into a 20 vs 20 game which is both hilariously fun and rage quittingly frustrating. So again, private games with friends trumps crazy hacker filled custom servers.\n\nFrom playing Left 4 Dead for nights on end on the Xbox 360 with my buddy (MrSneakyMan), listening to Rammstein in order to pump ourselves up to fight the horde, to finally downloading it on PC and pouring even more hours into it.
