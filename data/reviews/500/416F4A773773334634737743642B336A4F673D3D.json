Игра создана на движке Source версии 14 для платформ Windows NT и Xbox 360. Портированием игры на Xbox 360 занималась студия Certain Affinity[4]. 28 октября 2010 года игра стала доступна на Mac OS X.\n\nВпервые информация о Left 4 Dead появилась в рождественском номере журнала PC Gamer UK за 2006 год в виде шестистраничной статьи. А опробовать игру публика смогла на QuakeCon 2007 и Showdown 2007 LAN, прошедшей в американском городе Сан-Хосе. 6 ноября демоверсия Left 4 Dead стала доступна тем, кто сделал предварительный заказ через систему цифровой дистрибуции Steam. 11 ноября 2008 года она стала доступна публично. 18 ноября игра стала доступна через Steam для всех желающих. 20 ноября состоялся релиз коробочных версий в Америке, а 21 ноября — в Старом свете[5]. Версии для персонального компьютера и Xbox 360 полностью переведены на русский язык[6].\n\nИгра получила множество положительных отзывов. Разработчикам удалось хорошо передать мрачную атмосферу ужаса и отчаяния, которая возникла в результате распространения в игровой вселенной неизвестного вируса, превратившего людей в чудовищ. Благодаря работе «Режиссёра», искусственного интеллекта, следящего за действиями игроков и влияющего на игровой процесс, каждое прохождение игры уникально и неповторимо, а упор на командные действия делает игру одной из лучших среди кооперативных шутеров. Также уникальность этой серии шутеров придаёт необычный сетевой режим, в котором команды противников поставлены в разные условия: одни играют за людей, а другие — за Особых Заражённых.\n\n1 июня 2009 года на выставке Electronic Entertainment Expo Valve официально анонсировала полноценный сиквел Left 4 Dead 2[7]. Сиквел вышел 17 ноября того же года.","timestamp_created":1433515866,"timestamp_updated":1433515866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16204562","author":{"steamid":"76561197990645815","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2509,"last_played":1312268400},"language":"english","review":"I like it alot","timestamp_created":1433512217,"timestamp_updated":1433512217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545945942401885986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16198188","author":{"steamid":"76561198138674765","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1636,"last_played":1466079648},"language":"russian","review":"\"Ненавижу автобусы,ненавижу аэропорты,ненавижу маленькие городки,ненавижу самолеты,ненавижу ненавижу НЕНАВИЖУ!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1433477074,"timestamp_updated":1433477074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16195688","author":{"steamid":"76561198051757010","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1662,"last_played":1434750784},"language":"english","review":"Boring","timestamp_created":1433462648,"timestamp_updated":1433462648,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.391158849000930786","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16192737","author":{"steamid":"76561197986312675","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":6329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5950,"last_played":1382206231},"language":"german","review":"Left4Dead ist ein sehr gutes Spiel. \nAnfänglich war ich sehr skeptisch wie es als Einzelspieler mit 3 Computergesteuerten Mitspielern funktioniert. \nAber schon nach den ersten 10 Minuten im Spiel war ein gewisser Suchtfaktor vorhanden.\nAuf jeden Fall ne Kaufempfehlung","timestamp_created":1433449130,"timestamp_updated":1433449130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499375790357589722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16191762","author":{"steamid":"76561198117249476","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2074,"last_played":1654658205},"language":"english","review":"buy this now its that good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1433445713,"timestamp_updated":1433445713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16186252","author":{"steamid":"76561198063871669","num_games_owned":638,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":213,"playtime_at_review":4451,"last_played":1659888864},"language":"russian","review":"Классика жанра! \nа теперь немного подробнее:\n\nПлюсы игры:\n\n+ неплохой дубляж \n+ известный игровой движок source\n+ режим сражения\n+ достижения\n+ атмосфера\n+ фан с друзьями в режиме кампании в коопе\n\nМинусы игры:\n\n- быстро надоедающий геймплей\n- малое кол-во оружия\n- тупость ботов и даже порой напарников (что чаще всего)\n\nВывод: \n\nНеплохой зомби шутан с норм картинкой и в целом.

You have special infected such as;\nTank: Big guy (on steroids at least) is the hardest one to down. Take him down before he takes you down.\nBoomer: Big ugly pus filled infected. Pukes on you which covers your vision. His boomer bile also attracts the horde.\nSmoker: Long range enemy. Will grab you with his tongue and choke you.\nHunter: Close range, jumps on you, leaving you helpless until a team mate shoves him off.\nWitch: The witch will be sat on the floor crying, if you get near her she will stand up and growl. Annoy her and she will come after you. She will knock you down in one hit so it is best to avoid her or just shoot the living crap out of her before she can hit you.\n\nThe campaigns are basically short movies. You hit a safe room between each chapter. Make sure you pick up a med kit, heal and grab ammo. Guns are limited. You have a machine gun, shot gun and pistols. You can also pick up molotovs and pipe bombs. There are four or five chapters in each campaign, with the last chapter classed as a finale. You cannot avoid the masses of infected that come to get you whilst you wait for the rescue to arrive. Usually after the second tank appears and is killed, the rescue vehicle arrives. Always make sure you are near where the vehicle will stop as literally hundreds of enemies will appear making it difficult to get to the vehicle. Pistols are handy to carry as they have infinite ammo. \n\nAchievements on this game are pretty easy to pick up aside from a few.

Just like Castle Crashers, this game is for that special friendship group, composed of four friends. With this game, you will find a bounty of endless fun, especially when setting the game's difficulty to an all-time high, as it really gives you that experience of being an endangered species, with the more stronger zombies wanting you dead, thus extinct. From my point of view, you can already tell I hold this game in high regard. Probably due to the fact it [i]is[/i] developed by Valve.\n\nThe story takes place in an unamed location, within Pennsylvania. A highly contagious virus known as th ''Green Flu'' swarms the state, causing heavy mutation to human body cells and brain functions, resulting in the loss of humanity, meaning yes, the birth of zombies. \n\nTwo weeks after the infectious outbreak, four survivors, William ''Bill'' Overbeck, a bold, Vietnam veteran; Zoey, a sassy college student; Louis, an optimistic IT technician, and Francis, an aggressive outlaw biker, the four heroes of this game make their way through perilous cities, discovering along the way that the virus is causing more dangerous mutations. On a side note, the story of this game is split into campaigns, going in chronological order from top to bottom and progressively, the story is carried out on to the games sequel.\n\nThe player takes control of one of the four survivors; only if human players are not involved, thus the survivors are controlled by the CPU. The main objection of the game is to reach the safehouse after each level of the campaign. \n\nBeware to watch out for the special infected. These types of zombies are the strongest of the common infected and if you get incapitated by one, you won't be able to shake them off, but unless one of your fellow survivors lends a helping hand and kills the attacking zombie. So, this just goes to show that teamwork in this game is the key of getting farther and staying progressively stable to continue playing.\n\nGuns and other types of defense and weaponry, (in the shapes of molotovs and first-aid kits) are scattered among the map, usually on different occasions. This mainly happens after holding off an entire zombie horde, where they break through from left, right and centre. All of these weapons that you find are frequently random, but you can stick to the weapon you like the most. Just make sure to search for ammo at a seldom pace, especially if you're playing on a much higher difficulty. When outnumbered, just remember to always keep your health up, along with your teammates, as every chip of HP is precious into reaching the end of your goals.\n\nThis game is simply fantastic, but is usually overshadowed by its sequel, Left 4 Dead 2; possibly due to the inclusion of all campaigns found in this one and carried out in its said sequel. The one thing I personally prefer from this game is the feel of the slightly tighter controls it has when compared to Left 4 Dead 2. I would say this one is for the competitive players and the sequel is for the casual players. Considering you could just mess around, with the Shrek mod and all, and don't tell me you bloody haven't. It's a lot of fun and of course, the modding community adds to Left 4 Dead 2's advantage, much to this games' disadvantage.\n\nIn closing, I definitely recommend this game to all who are fans of survival horror video games and those itching to test their own determination and teamwork with one another. If you have have the sequel, I would still recommend getting this first game, just for its originality and or the fact you can add it to your godly Valve collection.","timestamp_created":1430156142,"timestamp_updated":1445790970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611515700817108154","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15574131","author":{"steamid":"76561198067146852","num_games_owned":974,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1527250021},"language":"english","review":"Rocket Tank/10.","timestamp_created":1430101492,"timestamp_updated":1430101492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471204221248626709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15572218","author":{"steamid":"76561198016187170","num_games_owned":740,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1620882296},"language":"english","review":"nordestinos, negros, judeus e pardos, dexem essa pragas morrerem","timestamp_created":1430092517,"timestamp_updated":1430092517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15564511","author":{"steamid":"76561198003017554","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1634710564},"language":"english","review":"Best game Ever!!","timestamp_created":1430068643,"timestamp_updated":1430068643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15530028","author":{"steamid":"76561198175335363","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8055,"last_played":1506678372},"language":"english","review":"when i first got steam i had left 4 dead 2. i wanted to get left 4 dead and once i got left 4 dead i got addictded to the game i tryed my best to get friends from this and so far i got l06 players in this game and if you want to play with me add me to your friends list and i will accept anyones friend request even if your not good at it i will help you get better.but 1 thing we need more players and workship addons for this game best game ever so add me :)","timestamp_created":1429941109,"timestamp_updated":1430947600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593040347099304199","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15515195","author":{"steamid":"76561198154814130","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1605343277},"language":"english","review":"This game is a blast when playing with a friend.
