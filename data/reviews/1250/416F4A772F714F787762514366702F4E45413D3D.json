Apparently KF seems to be a game that people will love or hate. \n\nIn KF the objective is to survive against “waves\" of enemies, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes in the last wave against the Patriarch (the final boss). Between waves you can buy weapons, armor, grenades, etc. One of the things that I like more about this game is the \"Zed Time”, it's something like the \"bullet-time\" in the Matrix movies and Max Payne games, you can see everything in “slow motion” for a few seconds, even in multiplayer. Graphics? They aren't the best, but IMO it doesn't matter, unless, of course, you are a graphic whore?\n\nOn other hand, I love Tripwire, they are one of the best and few PC-exclusive developers out there, and also because KF was released almost 3 years ago and they constantly are updating the game with free stuff.\n\n8.5/10\n","timestamp_created":1325082354,"timestamp_updated":1325082354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2795807","author":{"steamid":"76561198012742459","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":9830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4697,"last_played":1429393219},"language":"english","review":"YAY for killing things","timestamp_created":1325082189,"timestamp_updated":1325082189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4041776","author":{"steamid":"76561198031187489","num_games_owned":2330,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":23717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21950,"last_played":1481207211},"language":"english","review":"Must Buy!\nHAVE FUN!","timestamp_created":1325080394,"timestamp_updated":1325080394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"694551","author":{"steamid":"76561197975718378","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":31426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30222,"last_played":1423689583},"language":"english","review":"Great game, teamplay is essential to surviving the higher difficulties.

Even playing with absolute idiots is fun because it's great to see the last guy desperately trying to avoid death at every turn. When playing with people that know what they're doing, however, is when the game really shines.
