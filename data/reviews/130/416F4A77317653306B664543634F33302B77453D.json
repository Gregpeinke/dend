Se tardan unas 5 horas en jugarlo si vas lento y en modo difícil además de las veces que tengas que reiniciar el guardado por los bugs, porque hay bastantes. El modo difícil es realmente complicado la primera mitad del juego porque literalmente vas rapiñando balas hasta el punto que hay enemigos que te los tienes que saltar porque no te queda munición. Por otra parte como es lógico se entienden las limitaciones físicas que se tenía en el momento de forma que los gráficos sean un poco dañinos para la vista. Es realmente gratificante que no tengas que quitar el juego cada media hora por los dolores de cabeza que daban los toros títulos. En cuanto a los puzzles he de decir que la mayoría son mediocres y que hay muchos que están desaprovechados. Además no hay nuevas armas como en el opposing force lo que no lo hace tan disfrutable.

This made me scream \"That's Gordon \n                                                                     Freeman and i'm the security guard from the original game\" This was FREAKING \n                                                                      AWESOME to me it felt amazing,Fantastic immersion Gearbox. Anyways the door opens and you go inside and explore in this area of Black Mesa you get to the training room and get your pistol ready shooting targets is optional to the player but i shot them because well i wanted to. Anyways if you played Half Life you know everything is going to absolute hell and well it starts to happen here. Systems aren't working in the sector as scientists try to fix bugging and nagging security guards to fix it. You start to get a bad feeling and here comes the part that made me scream \"OH MY GOD!\" You start to go into an elevator to do your work when it stops for a bit. I looked at my two scientist friends confused when suddenly we started to go down pretty fast and part of the elevator killed one of my buddies i was like oh no it's going to hell now. I looked out the window and saw a scientist run away from a vortigaunt and get killed then i looked to the other side of the room. I saw a scientist running from 2 houndeyes and a security guard behind the 2 houndeyes started shooting at them. When the tram alert went off that security guard yelled \" HEYYY!\" as the  cart went flying into the room and exploded by where the scientist died BOOM! this part is such good story telling and is the essential introduction to a game. You keep looking around black mesa after that incident and a scientist tells you to meet up with someone named Dr.Rosenburg. So you eventually meet up with Rosenburg and he wants to teleport out of black mesa but first he needs to teleport you to Xen to get a crystal. And i will say Blue shift's Xen is probably the best out of the original half life and its expansions. It's really pretty so you get the crystal and go back to Rosenburg. He tells you to go to the lower levels of Black Mesa to get something i forgot what it was. You send it back up to him and you go back. He starts teleporting everyone out of there with your help. Your the last one to go through it and you hear the military coming you run to the portal and teleport outside then to xen then to by where the military was dragging Gordon to the Trash Compactor again Gearbox did another great moment of story telling. You teleport back to where Rosenburg was and  drive away from Black Mesa. I had only two complaints with this game reduced weapons and short story it's ok though because it was originally intended as a free addon for the cancelled Dreamcast port of Half Life. It's a great expansion not as good as HL or HLOF but another Masterpiece that EVERYONE should try 5 λ out of 5   λ\nSubject B.Calhoun\nStatus Out of Range\nNo further comments","timestamp_created":1585941716,"timestamp_updated":1585941927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66523508","author":{"steamid":"76561198124717728","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1590120982},"language":"english","review":"Short yet fun expansion of Half-Life.

I am a Black woman, a college graduate, and a survivor of police brutality. I’m choosing to tell my story because, sadly, this wasn’t the last time something like this happened to a person of color in Peoria, Illinois, and that must change.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, I was a happy 17-year-old looking forward to attending college at Millikin University. I had just graduated high school, where I was ranked 11th in my entire class and spoke at graduation as one of my final duties as Senior Class President.\n\nThat night, I was at my friend Cipriana’s house, where family and friends had gathered to celebrate our graduation and Cipriana’s departure for Army basic training. We were having a bonfire in the backyard, eating s’mores and drinking Capri Suns.\n\nAs I sat in a lawn chair, a bright light suddenly shone in my eyes. I thought someone at the party was using their phone’s flashlight or had turned on the backyard light, so I put my hand up to shield my eyes and politely asked them to stop pointing it at me. The person ignored my request and asked for my ID. Confused and still unable to see anything, I asked the person why she wanted to see my ID card. She never answered or stated who she was.\n\nInstead, I was yanked out of my chair by what turned out to be three police officers, two men and one woman.\n\nThe officers grabbed me by the wrists and twisted my arms, then dragged me to the front yard and slammed me up against the brick house. I thought they were going to break my arm and I told them they were hurting me. The male officer responded, “Shut the hell up!”\n\nI was handcuffed, then dragged across the concrete driveway, thrown onto the hood of the squad car, and searched. As my friends came up to ask why this was happening, the officers screamed at them, “Get back!”\n\nThe officers shoved me into the back of the squad car, punching and pushing my body. I gasped in pain as I sat awkwardly in the back seat, scared and stunned that this was happening. Not once did anyone tell me why I was being arrested or what I had done wrong.\n\nAt this point, my right shoulder was in excruciating pain, my right knee was swollen, and I had swelling and cuts on both my wrists. I was taken to the Peoria County Jail, where I asked for medical attention, but was denied. I was held until 5:30 a.m. the next day, when they finally let my mother pick me up.\n\nLater, I learned I had a torn labrum in my shoulder and an incapacitated wrist, which — combined — required three surgeries, steroid injections, and physical therapy over the next several years. My entire right side was immobilized and one doctor said that my injuries looked like what football players might have after years of being tackled.\n\nBeyond my physical injuries, this experience has taken a huge toll on me mentally. I’m now fearful of the police, and I constantly worry that something like this could happen to me again.\n\nThere was nothing illegal happening at the party. Yet I was arrested and cited for “resisting or obstructing a peace officer.” The officers said they entered the backyard out of concern for the safety of those at the party, but the only danger anyone faced that night was at the hands of the Peoria Police Department.\n\nThese past six years, my family and I have witnessed how little accountability there is for police officers in Peoria. Without accountability, the unnecessary and excessive use of force I experienced will continue to happen to others.\n\nOur city is no stranger to the kinds of headlines about fatal police interactions that we see across the country. We all know the tragic story of Eddie Russell Jr., who was shot 17 times by the Peoria Police Department despite their knowledge of his history of mental health crises.\n\nIt’s time we fight for justice for our fellow community members and demand real reform in the Peoria Police Department.\n\nSo I can only give this game a 7/10, was pretty good.","timestamp_created":1585720589,"timestamp_updated":1585720589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530212938785552979","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66311476","author":{"steamid":"76561198147618800","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1585714746},"language":"spanish","review":"Corto comparado a la primera entrega pero cumple su función de narrar, entretener y poder encarnar el papel que tuvo Barney Calhoun en el incidente de Black Mesa, además viene con una pequeña mejora grafica respecto a armas hablamos, durante la partida me tope con un bug pero nada que afecte a su jugabilidad...","timestamp_created":1585715027,"timestamp_updated":1585715540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66310314","author":{"steamid":"76561198333140938","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1586225710},"language":"english","review":"yes\n\n[spoiler]as said in the Opposing Force one, sosad Gearbox ended up how they did today ;-;[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1585713557,"timestamp_updated":1585713557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66301605","author":{"steamid":"76561198211838044","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1585702746},"language":"spanish","review":"Blue Shift es una de las secuelas de Half life, en donde encarnamos a Barney Calhoun, un oficial de seguridad de Black Mesa, en donde estaremos presentes en desastre que pasa en el primer juego, lucharemos por sobrevivir mientras buscamos como escapar.

Watch out for potential spoilers !!\n\nThis review assumes that you have not played Half-Life.\n\nIn Half-Life: Blue Shift, you play as a security officer named Barney Calhoun [spoiler] who becomes one of Gordon's allies in HL2 and Episode One [/spoiler] as he attempts to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility in the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident (if you haven't played HL1, which you should, the BMI was a thing where a bunch of aliens got onto Earth, specifically the BM facility, due to a Xen crystal opening a rift during a test gone wrong). \n\nIn terms of gun variety, Calhoun gets no new weaponry, unlike Shephard and Freeman. Calhoun gets even less than the both of them, only getting a (in order of weapon slot, also by their HD equivalents) Crowbar, Beretta, Colt Python, M4 rifle, SPAS-12 shotgun (which oddly has a double-barrel function, bound to alt-fire key), a rebar crossbow, a RPG, satchel charges, Snarks (an alien species you can throw at people and they'll kill them, but will chase you if there are no enemies nearby or left, but will explode after about 10-15 seconds), and a few grenades for the most part.\n\nIn terms of enemy variety, you've got mostly the same enemies coming at you from the base game. Calhoun will encounter the HECU Marines (a Marine special forces unit sent in to \"clean up\" the BMI, but ends up shooting everyone present before eventually pulling out as seen at the end of HL1's Earthbound levels), Headcrabs (a species of aliens that will attempt to latch onto the face of their victim, turning them into a fairly dangerous zombie), Vortigaunts (an enslaved species by the Nihilanth, who now are forced to fight for him and do basic work on the Xen planet), Houndeyes (an alien species that will attempt to shockwave the player when nearby, and their shockwaves do more damage when they are in larger packs/groups), Bullsquids (an alien species that will attack most other species, spit acid, and can whip the player with the tail if they get too close), Barnacles (another alien species that will attempt to choke and digest their victims via strangulation and consumption), Alien Grunts (the military backbone of the Xenian forces), and Alien Controllers (baby-headed things that fly around and shoot energy balls at you, and act like overseers/elite troops of the Xenian military).\n\nThe gameplay itself is similar to HL1, and the melee is fairly garbage (hit, run back, etc). There are also a few escort missions, which can get annoying if someone you're supposed to be escorting keeps dying over and over again because of something extremely stupid.\n\nAll in all, Blue Shift is a mediocre/okay expansion pack for Half-Life, showing us some new areas not seen in Opposing Forces or the original Half-Life.\n\n\n!! Ending spoilers !! \n[spoiler] Blue Shift ends at the same point as Chapter 9 (\"Apprehension\") in Half-Life 1, and Calhoun can see Freeman being dragged through a hallway by two HECU grunts after being knocked out in an ambush. However, Calhoun and his fellow allies (Rosenberg, Walter, and Simmons) likely escape closer to the beginning of Chapter 10 (\"Residue Processing\").","timestamp_created":1585437244,"timestamp_updated":1585437244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66042071","author":{"steamid":"76561198080220799","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1585501088},"language":"russian","review":"Дополнение к легендарной игре, которое поведает историю Барни - офицера службы безопасности Чёрной Мезы.","timestamp_created":1585432119,"timestamp_updated":1585432119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66037456","author":{"steamid":"76561198230024688","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1585441759},"language":"spanish","review":"HALF LIFE AZUL","timestamp_created":1585427228,"timestamp_updated":1585427228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vS0kfECcO30+wE="}
