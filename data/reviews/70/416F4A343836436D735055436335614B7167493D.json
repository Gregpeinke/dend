Valve is known to release major games and most of them are some of the most memorable games there are. This is a game that was released in 1998 and it still holds up today as a fantastic game. I cannot recommend this game enough and Steam has it on sale all the time so just pick it up, you won't be disappointed. The only thing I would complain about is how the story ends because it is so abrupt. It left me with a lot of questions but I suppose that's what the next games are for,

lack of instructions and arrows to tell you where to go are part of what makes this game immersive (even though the graphics haven't aged well). It is also, in a sense, a weakness, as I was sometimes stuck, not knowing what to do, because no interactive object really stands out (aside from, what, the red buttons?). And not knowing where to go too, I found the backtracking really confusing. \nThe large variety of weapons calls for strategy. Count your ammo too, sometimes you're short! Again, the lack of instructions on how to use some weapons is hindering progression. Especially when you haven't seen anyone use that weapon in front if you, so you don't even know what it is supposed to do (if you know the one I am talking about, seriously, tell me: how were we supposed to know?). Some weapons are dangerous in close quarters, experimenting could end badly :,)\nSome parts of the game are plain traps, you have to die at least once to know how to avoid/get prepared. I don't really care, I save often, but new player beware!\nSome jumps are tricky, and frustrating. Those are rare, and the way you can use the map is interesting! Screw ladders though. And screw those people who are supposed to follow you and open doors, sometimes they won't...\nA lot of different maps, even if some don't make sense, you still get the feeling you went through half the globe lol","timestamp_created":1603898601,"timestamp_updated":1603898601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78290874","author":{"steamid":"76561199055519393","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1660491632},"language":"russian","review":"Купил заместо второй ибо нищий.

Nós controlamos um cientista de 27 anos. Ele está atrasado para o serviço e precisa chegar ao laboratório de testes para uma análise de um material desconhecido, até que... tudo vai pelos ares! Logo de cara o jogo nos coloca em um cenário caótico em que nós, assim como o protagonista, não fazemos ideia do que está acontecendo. É um mapa gigantesco para um jogo dos anos 90 e cada fase possuí um puzzle diferente que fica a nossa escolha a melhor forma de resolve-lo (Alô fãs de Portal 1/2!). É tão bom que terminamos com um gostinho de quero mais.\n\nDurante a gameplay nos deparamos com: elienígenas, monstros, entidades misteriosas, cientistas gritando, seguranças da instalação, jumpscares, labirintos, quebra-cabeças, exército, alarmes de segurança, mais explosões, portais abertos de um lado para o outro, planetas (ou lugares?) alienígena e muito além disso!\n\nO jogo possui 02 finais, bem simples até, mas daqueles que nos deixam com a pulga atrás da orelha, uma vez que termina de forma muito abrupta. Se você gosta de DOOM, QUAKE, WOLFENSTEIN e PORTAL, você vai adorar Half Life! \n\nVale lembrar que é um jogo muito leve, muito leve MESMO! Lembro-me que foi um dos pouquíssimos jogos que rodou a 60 FPS no meu falecido Celeron de 01 GB RAM e sem placa de vídeo.

Im not going to spoil to much but at the start of the game you travel to the entrance of the lab by train in the black mesa complex. which is kinda part of the portal story but don't worry about it. Anyways throughout the whole ride theirs alot shown with the environments of the facility showing the process of the maintenance in the building going deeper and deeper down from the rails. Truly a great introduction in video games that you can only see once. Because after that it only gets boring with it being so long that you cant even skip. I guess they didn't have that technology back in 1998. I think that's all I need to say. Theirs is a huge point at the start that changes everything but that all I need to say. You should probably play the first in the series before the others. The story gets very complicated fast. That's all I need to say... about the story! don't even get me started on the gameplay. \"You cant do it\". Who said that? O i'm getting started now. The gameplay is incredible I don't really think that the guns are what make the gameplay fun its the enemy and item placement the really shines. The movement is a bit weird with long jumps and walking for no reason. Just play the game then play half life 2 that's where it really gets good. I mean really good. If I had 2$ for every time I said gameplay I could buy this game again.
