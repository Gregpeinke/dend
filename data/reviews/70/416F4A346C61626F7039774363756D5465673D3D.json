to find in order to progress in the game.That is the style of gameplay that made FPS games popular and because of that TOO many games came and because of no updates or new ideas the genre was starting to die.But then a legend was born and saved the day,maybe the week,month or the existence of FPS games.The legends' name,as you probably thought is Half-Life.\n\nHalf-Life runs on the Gold Source engine which gives it a unique look with great mechanics.\n\nIt has a great and long story which can keep the player in the games due to the amazing story and experience.\n\nIt has a variety of weapons which are all different from each other.\n\nWhy would you need weapons without enemies ? Answer:You don't.But now seriously,Half-Life throws a lot of enemies at you which are really well detailed.\n\nFinally,I strongly recommend Half-Life and it's expansions.If you aren't sure,just wait for a sale and get it for 1$.\n\nFinal verdict-10/10 Would blast  Nihilanth again! \n\n","timestamp_created":1497948038,"timestamp_updated":1497948038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32583726","author":{"steamid":"76561198390566413","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":814,"last_played":1577856298},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome.

Un gioco davvero sensazionale, che fa del level design il suo punto di forza. Difatti, il level design è meglio del 90% dei giochi attuali, segno che gli sviluppatori moderni hanno imparato poco o niente, continuando essi a sviluppare giochi con mappe unidirezionali e senza strade alternative, più o meno difficili. Ho avuto difficoltà giocando a normale, quindi se siete alla ricerca di qualcosa di impegnativo è particolarmente consigliato. Consigliato in generale a chiunque, è un must-have per ogni PC gamer, hardcore o meno che sia, amante degli FPS o meno che sia.\n\nPS: ovviamente dovete aspettarvi grafica e audio datati essendo un gioco del 1998, ma questo non influisce assolutamente sul gameplay.

This is another game I mostly missed when I came out, so I'm not writing this out of nostalgia. This is simply a joy to play throughout, mixing tight shooting with some clever first-person puzzle design. Even the platforming sections are good, although in the latter part of the game where you enter an alien world, there are some \"trampoline\" spots on the floor which are supposed to launch you into the air when you step on them. However, I found them to be unreliable - sometimes they seemed to not work and required a bit of trial and error to get you in the air.\n\nHalf-Life's main claim to FPS fame is its level design - it's very tight and well-designed, showing the triple-A gaming industry of today that you don't always need an \"open world\" to be immersive. Cleverly designed linear paths can do the job if it is believable and has enough variety to keep you entertained, which Half-Life does very well. Another part of its level design that was revolutionary at the time and still holds up well today is how they are constructed - there are no long loading screens, cutscenes, or ludicrous splits between levels. It is all contiguous and seamless, meaning that throughout the game there are very few points that give you a feeling of complete \"safety\" - enemies can often reach you anywhere, and the game feels like one long sequence rather than several shoddily tied-together ones. The lack of cutscenes means the story is told through what are referred to as \"scripted sequences\" - meaning that in order to learn what is happening, it pays to pay attention to what is happening around you and listen to what NPCs are saying. This could be a conversation between survivors, or listening to a radio signal. I love good cutscenes - like the beautiful ones in Thief II for instance - but Half-Life shows a different way of doing things and makes it more than just a shooter.\n\nBut Half-Life IS a shooter - and thankfully the shooting is brilliant. The weapons all feel different and unique, and have their advantages and disadvantages. The AI holds up well especially for the time, knowing when to retreat and where and when to use projectile weapons - like grenades for instance. There is a satisfying variety of human and non-human opponents all with different modes of attack. There are only a couple of boss fights - the last of which is a bit weird. Both, however, are quite challenging and thankfully the levels they are designed in allow for either tactics or all-guns blazing, which is very risky. The game does not hold your hand with objective lists or mission markers, so don't miss anything important! Especially not switches - don't rush through areas just because they have no enemies! I did this once during a genuinely tense section where a set of tentacles guard a missile silo and had to go back again to turn the switches on. Oh, and make sure you do the training section at the beginning of the game - I missed this and therefore didn't know how to do a long jump three-quarters of the way through the game!\n\nOne area where the game does show its age is the limited character modelling, animation and voice acting, but then many modern games today are no better in this area. It does mean, however, that we had to wait until Half-Life 2 until we got a set of different characters that we built a relationship with and who had a set of distinct dialogue. But if you want shooter action with clever design, Half-Life still delivers. Oh, and the game is surprisingly gory and graphic - dismembered body parts fall out of broken air vents, blood spatters out of soldier's bodies, and tanks and planes blow up into smithereens. Definitely try this game if you're looking for a shooter that takes you on a challenging, continuous journey rather than just dumping you in lots of different places at a time and does most of the shooting for you.\n","timestamp_created":1496962595,"timestamp_updated":1496962595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729269146919250488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32262919","author":{"steamid":"76561198286161824","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1583909355},"language":"schinese","review":"重温小学时候玩的经典","timestamp_created":1496908754,"timestamp_updated":1496908754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52734375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32248100","author":{"steamid":"76561197987175590","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":177,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1649261936},"language":"english","review":"[u]What I liked about the game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]\tBrilliant story.

crap, this was a fun game.

It's first person shooter style map was one of the first I played, and I love it. I probably won it on easy in around 14 hours. Though it does have so problems. 1: Item pushing and pulling. If you push it while pressing \"e,\" the item flys away. If you pull the item from an angle, which pulling requires \"e,\" then it goes flying backwards. 2: Plateforming. You move so fast, that it is incredibly hard to do sometimes. Make sure that you never forget to \"F6\" (Quick save) and to \"F7\" (Quick load) EVER! You will regret it.

This game will always be good, no matter how old it gets in time. This is where it all started for what we consider \"modern\" shooters. A fun story, vast array of weapons to use, nice variety of enemies to fight, good pacing, interesting puzzles, the list goes on. I use to prefer playing the source engine version because of the better lighting, phsyics, and general atmoshpere, but there is no real mechanical different. The better physics simply being that you don't go off the ground from even the slightest incline, but that's fairly negligable. Nowadays, though, you really might as well play this version because, somewhere down the line, the sourc version turned into a horribly buggy mess. I finished my first playthrough of this version in 8.3 hours, which is a nice, robust length for a game like this. It also makes it the longest the orignal \"trilogy\" (Half-life, Blue Shift, and Opposing Force). I don't usually say that you can't call yourself a gamer unless you've played games X, Y, and Z, but this is definitely one of those classic that EVERYONE, especially if you're a big shooter fan, should play at least once and for only $10 it's definitely worth it. Now, if you want to get all 3 of the original half life games, then do buy the Half-Life 1 Anthology which includes this, Blue Shift, and Opposing for super cheap (me paying like just under $14 for it). My only real complaint about this game is the last stretch that takes place in a world called \"Xen\" which is where all the aliens come from. I, personally, HATE the last stretch of this game, but I won't let that ruined the rest of it and neither should you. My reasons for hating Xen are really all my own and are 100% subjective. Buy this with the Anthology and play all 3 original Half-Life games, you won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1496191201,"timestamp_updated":1496191201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32067049","author":{"steamid":"76561198057755677","num_games_owned":732,"num_reviews":836,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1486770585},"language":"english","review":"Do I need to review this?
