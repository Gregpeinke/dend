ошеломительного успеха первого Half-life в 1998 году,Valve решила расширить молодую франшизу выпуском сюжетного аддона.Работу на себя взяла новорожденная компания GearBox Software(BorderLands,BorderLands 2),для которой этот проект был первым.GearBox решила не останавливаться на контенте первого Half-Life,поэтому они ввели много нового оружия,много интересных противников.Всё это в комплекте с интересным сюжетом и мультиплеером позволило этому аддону выделиться и стать одной из любимых частей большого колличества фанатов вселенной half-life.\n\nВкратце пройдёмся по плюсам и минусам:\nПлюсы:\n-Качественный и интересный левл дизайн,который местами и вовсе не уступает оригиналу.\n-Много нового оружия(правда,большинство из новых оружий является альтернативой старому оружию и заменяет оное\nиз оригинального HL).\n-Интересные новые противники(Некоторые противники также,как и оружие,являются альтернативой и заменяют других из Half-Life,а некоторые так и вовсе являются абсолютно новыми)\n-Хороший Сюжет,который показывает нам события Half-life с совершенно другой стороны.\n-Теперь напарники играют более главную роль,чем в Half-Life.Можно собраться целым отрядом солдат и идти мочить пришельцев!\n\nМинусы:\n-Маленькая продолжительность(Проходится за 5-6 часов,что в сравнении с Half-Life ну уж очень мало.)\n-Очень плохой,скучный,ничем не примечательный финальный босс.\n\n8.5/10 Всем любителям Half-Life и просто любителям хороших шутеров рекомендуется к ознакомлению,несмотря на большой возраст данного аддона.","timestamp_created":1646470761,"timestamp_updated":1646470761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558823525905609131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111567039","author":{"steamid":"76561198074151396","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1646505863},"language":"spanish","review":"si","timestamp_created":1646453697,"timestamp_updated":1646453697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111563602","author":{"steamid":"76561199078615625","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1654761401},"language":"english","review":"Opposing

I found this one quite complete and certainly alluring, to the point where I could personally say that I enjoyed it just as much as the original Half-Life. For this expansion they added many changes to make you really feel immersed into the character of Adrian Shephard, a US Marine that has been sent to Black Mesa to eliminate all the invaders coming from Xen. You often get to play through some levels together with your Marine comrades too, and they help with fire power and health.\n\nThroughout the chapters you find totally new weapons and tools that were not available in the base game. For example, instead of the flashlight you get the night vision mode; instead of the crossbow you get to use a powerful sniper rifle; and instead of the classic crowbar you get a wrench and a knife. As for the new alien weapons, you can use the Displacer Cannon that has a teleport function on the secondary fire click that takes you to different locations inside Xen; you can also obtain a Barnacle’s tongue to grapple onto certain surfaces; there is a Spore Launcher with Spore fruit as ammo; and you get to use a Shock Roach as a weapon with totally unlimited ammo that auto-regenerates with time. \n\nThe ambiance feels quite achieved, with many dark areas that you must go through using the night vision mode and having no clue as for where you are going or where to look at, which makes for some interesting and even frightening scenarios. The experience overall is not too glitchy, and those glitches that you do find are not game breaking at all. Mostly just getting stuck in trap doors or ramps, from which you will have to noclip out of.\n\nAlthough not being canon, I think this is a great addition to the saga and gives an interesting insight to the story of Black Mesa from the perspective of the Marines. Totally recommended if you previously enjoyed the original release and want some more content. I do feel that Opposing Force, together with Blue Shift, make this first part of the story feel just a little bit more rounded overall.\n","timestamp_created":1645828217,"timestamp_updated":1645828217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110999040","author":{"steamid":"76561199056948004","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1645813334},"language":"turkish","review":"Half life ama daha iyi","timestamp_created":1645812811,"timestamp_updated":1645812811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110994081","author":{"steamid":"76561198163504111","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1645809275},"language":"norwegian","review":"awsm","timestamp_created":1645809310,"timestamp_updated":1645809310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110993594","author":{"steamid":"76561198453318479","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1650206760},"language":"polish","review":"---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☑ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☐ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☑ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☑ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☑ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

As such, it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs.\n\nOpposing Force's story recounts the events of Half-Life, but from the opposing side's perspective as implied by the title. You are Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. You've been sent to the Black Mesa Research Facility to locate and eliminate Gordon Freeman. As in the original, things immediately go awry, mistakes are made, people die, and your initial plan is replaced with a complicated fight for survival. It's a testament to the success of Half-Life that its story actually warrants retelling. The developers know that while Adrian Shephard has no idea what Freeman is doing, you do, and they pack the game with clues as to where you are in relation to Half-Life's hero. Your path initially converges with Freeman's, then takes some unexpected detours. Many of the original settings and incidents are referred to or revisited from a slightly altered perspective, and it's a ringing endorsement of their effectiveness that to give any of them away would lessen your enjoyment of the game.","timestamp_created":1645758202,"timestamp_updated":1645758202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110880010","author":{"steamid":"76561198344952139","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1645704379},"language":"turkish","review":"ciğeri
