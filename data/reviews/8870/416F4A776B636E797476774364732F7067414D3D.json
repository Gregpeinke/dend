Mais à voir plus de 90% de commentaires positifs et des notes sur certains sites le montrant comme une perle du 21ème siècle, j'ai tout de même de la peine...\n\nFaut compter 10-15 heures pour boucler l'histoire. Les combats sont assez dynamiques avec des armes assez variées et à cela on ajoute encore des pouvoirs différents, mais aussi assez répétitif. L'IA est pas extraordinaire, mais ce n'est pas ça qui m'a gêné le plus. A cour de munitions? ça vous arrivera et vous devrez passer à une autre arme pour continuer de combattre. Alors j'ai vu certaines critiques là-dessus, mais en toute honnêteté je trouvais cela presque bien, car cela forçait de changer d'arme et sa façon de jouer. Les graphismes sont bons et l'univers original. La présence d'Elisabeth est agréable.\n\nEt le négatif? Pour moi c'est l'histoire ou plutôt la fin. Pour moi on nous balance dans un bordel temporel/monde parallèle truffé d'incohérences et avec une multitudes de questions en suspens. J'ai pas de soucis de partir dans ces histoires de monde parallèle ou temporel, mais là pendant 8h on vous donne au goûte à goûte et à la fin on balance tout. Seulement que je trouve qu'il y a peins de choses incohérentes ou pas clair et au final ce qui aurait pu être un jeu assez sympa devient un jeu lambda.\n\nSi je devais le noter je lui donnerai 14-15 sur 20.

Like, pretty stinkin' bad. I played it all in one sitting, the DLC over the next two days or so, and it ended up probably becoming the worst 9-12 hours I've ever spent playing a game. Those 3 extra hours (I think) were mostly from pause breaks and having to replay sections due to the fact that there are no manual saves and only checkpoints.\n\nNow, I'd [i]love[/i] to write an excessively long, detailed essay about how much I dislike this game. I'd [i]love[/i] to go into every single little nitpick I had with this game. I'd [i]love[/i] to list every pro (which are few in number), con, and \"meh\" of this game, but I'm not going to.\nUnfortunately, I'd probably exceed the character limit and bore everyone who reads this thing to death because of its length. So, to the best of my ability, I'll just keep things as brief as humanly possible and only point out the major stuff. Yeah, this review's still gonna be a [i]little bit[/i] long, but it won't put you to sleep as quickly as it would if I really doubled down.\n\nIf you have played Bioshock 1 & 2 (or even its spiritual predecessor, System Shock) and [i]liked[/i] those games, then this game is a severely painful slap in the face. If you have not played those games, then this would be incredibly mediocre at best and an extremely boring slog at worst. Heck, you might hate it regardless.\nThe gameplay is incredibly dumbed down from its predecessors. Combat is excessively easy and requires little to no strategy or skill. You can only carry two guns at one time, which isn't much in terms of \"balance\" because nearly more than half of the guns are useless. A designated melee weapon slot has been removed and replaced with a designated melee attack key (and your melee attack cannot be upgraded, so it does the same amount of damage unless you equip gear that affects melee). Weapon and Vigor upgrades are too easily accessible, can be purchased at almost any time, and by extension don't really allow for individual builds and unique styles of gameplay since it [i]is possible[/i] to buy every upgrade in the game. Additionally, weapon and Vigor upgrades are really expensive, so even when you find enough money to buy one $1,000 upgrade for something, you're probably not going to be able to buy another one for a while unless you horde money like a crazy person. That, or you forget to buy anything at all and check to see that you have a couple hundred thousand dollars sitting around in your pockets, which is kinda what happened to me on occasion.\nAll-in-1 Health/Salt/\"Shield\" stat upgrades replace health and EVE upgrades, and you can only pick one at a time when found as opposed to purchasing with ADAM. And oh yeah, all upgrades (aside from base stats) use the same currency so there's no secondary currency you need to be saving up for special attributes and abilities, which makes progression a tad less complex.\nMost of the Vigors are useless and all practically have the exact same function (save for a handful, and by that I mean like 2 or 3 of them), that being to stun enemies. All Vigors have a trap function, instead of said trap functions being an optional upgrade, or having a designated \"trap Vigor\". Overall, Vigors have no variety and are for the most part useless. No matter what Vigor you use, it will do the same thing as all the others. It's really just a matter of which Vigor you think looks the coolest, which one stuns enemies the longest, and which one does the most damage.\nThe game's linear nature in terms of level design is one thing that people like to complain about, which I honestly don't care for [i]as much[/i] as other people, but it is a problem I guess. Exploration is practically nowhere to be seen, which I understand is definitely a bummer. And yeah, the battle arenas are pretty stupid and they get really annoying if there's one every five seconds. The fact that enemies become bullet sponges at about the halfway point or so doesn't help with this either. The criticism of this game having way too many combat arenas is honestly well-deserved. Instead of small, brief encounters that last only a few seconds, we get annoying, drawn out fights in intentionally open areas. Bioshock 2 had that issue on rare occasions, but if you were at all strategic and competent about combat the arenas weren't that much of a drag and fights didn't have to last longer than a few minutes. This game however, with its stupidly simple combat, removes any and all necessity to be calculated and efficient in how you fight a big wave of enemies. \nElizabeth is your AI partner, and she basically becomes a crutch if the game feels like it isn't already holding your hand enough. She gives you Ammo, Salts, Health, Money, and her tear ability gives you a huge advantage over nearly every obstacle that comes your way. No more health kits, no more EVE Hypos, no more alternative ammo types, no more resource management, no more Gene Tonics, just an endless supply of salts and health from your trusty partner. What a joy, what a treat.\nThe story's really shit. Even if you ignore this game's title, the story is abysmal, confusing, and pretentious. It tries to be deep and intriguing, but it ends up being more of a nonsensical mess of out-of-place sociopolitical issues. Issues that, normally would be fine if presented in a decent and sensitive way, are instead barely explored beyond \"racism bad\" and \"extremist ideologies bad\". In other words, this game tries to be edgy without justifying its edginess. Perhaps this game's controversial themes were simply pandering to the storytelling methods of its contemporaries at the time.\nAlso, this game for some reason throws in weird sci-fi fantasy pseudo-quantum physics malarkey that totally throws everything off the rails and completely severs itself from the rest of the series. The character of Elizabeth drives nearly the whole plot, and that, to me, puts her dangerously close towards Mary Sue territory. Think what you want about Elizabeth's character design, but she, as a character, is really boring and uninteresting. All the other characters are pretty boring too. No depth, no true development, no nothing. There was also some other deep stuff they threw in, but it too horrendously failed to peak my interest or intrigue at all.\nPeople like to complain about the plot twist at the end the most, which I myself didn't complain about, mostly because the rest of the story confused and bewildered me so much that by the time I reached the end my brain was just absolutely numb and unable to comprehend what I was witnessing at all. [spoiler]However, the tie-in to the first game really pissed me off, as it looked like the devs just went \"Hey look, it's Rapture! Remember Rapture?\"[/spoiler]\nBurial at Sea, the game's DLC, was a step in not exactly the [i]right[/i] direction, but the more [i]serviceable[/i] direction. Going back to Rapture was nice, and seeing a pre-Bioshock 1 Rapture was kinda cool in the beginning. The art direction changed a lot, though, and some of it seemed a bit jarring to me. But hey, gotta update the art direction for a new era, I guess? Ep. 1 REALLY wanted to bring back resource management to the point of obsession. Ep. 2 was interesting, turning into a stealth game which I haven't ever seen in the series. It was a bit frustrating, though, both Episodes. The story was still kinda crap, though. [spoiler]The tie-in with Bioshock 1 is that Elizabeth, apparently, was the one responsible for giving Fontaine control of Jack. Therefore, Elizabeth is the reason why most of the events of Bioshock even occur. When I saw that, I felt no regret in [i]firmly placing Elizabeth in the Mary Sue Club.[/i] What a load of bullcrap. Burial at Sea was overall ok, but I will [b]never[/b] forgive it for trying to cram itself into the series' timeline that forcefully, especially with fucking Elizabeth at the helm.[/spoiler]\n\ntl;dr Kevin Levine is a damn hack. 2.05/10","timestamp_created":1634249318,"timestamp_updated":1634249318,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.414469480514526367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101053521","author":{"steamid":"76561198028157237","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1655321340},"language":"spanish","review":"Exquisito","timestamp_created":1634241585,"timestamp_updated":1634241585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101052214","author":{"steamid":"76561198116823637","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1021,"last_played":1634412458},"language":"english","review":"Great story\n","timestamp_created":1634239525,"timestamp_updated":1634239525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101049705","author":{"steamid":"76561198143066217","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1481,"last_played":1634235158},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1]Bueno pero podría ser mejor[/h1]\nBioshock Infinitela entrega más reciente de esta franquicia, para mi el juego base se siente algo crudo al compararlo con sus antecesores, principalmente no me gustó no poder guardar la partida a voluntad, lo cual fue algo molesto al principio, pero por otro lado al menos el juego no crashea, como los remastered del 1 y el 2.

The story is a shallow and underdeveloped argument against racism and offers no insights into it being a part of society other than, \"it's just a product of the times, y'know man?\" Linearity in game design is never a bad thing, but when the first title in the series is one of the most immersive experiences in gaming history that makes you forget you're in a fictional setting at times, I become disappointed when I don't see the same effort and love put into the followup. Columbia is nothing more than a surface-level set-piece for you to parade through, guns blazing, maybe once or twice. There's very little reason to come back to this game as the same love given to the prior entries (yes, that even means 2) is absent in place of meeting a deadline. I don't claim I know what happened behind the scenes in this game, but man for a game with three rewrites you'd think they would've thought things through a little more. It just fails as a followup to Bioshock 1 and 2 in an unfathomable amount of ways, including dumbing down your ability to customize your character (not very \"infinite\" if you ask me). That's not to say there aren't redeeming qualities. After all, the Lutes twins are immediately recognizable characters to me despite only appearing in this one game. The concept of another failed utopia isn't bad either, it's just poorly executed. Columbia, due to the lack of real meaningful time spent exploring individual districts of the city, ultimately makes it feels forgettable, and, as a consequence, so does the message its existence is trying to give. This game could've been something good and provided meaningful conversation on the complex topic of racism as its predecessors did with objectivism and collectivism.

Shooting is standard, powers are kinda fun if a little clunky to use, you can only carry 2 weapons at once and none of them are memorable, weapon upgrades are boring, and story is ok. It suffers from a lack in enemy variety (the replacement for big daddy is this handyman guy that kinda sucks) and the game isnt very difficult until the last couple areas.

It feels more like a spiritual successor with a hard call-back in it. That said, BioShock or not, this game is fantastic. BioShock 1 was an interesting title, it took the FPS and turned it into something new, created a unique experience. BioShock 2 built on that. It ironed out the wrinkles and improved on what worked, all while being bold enough to try something new. This gave us was what is in my opinion one of the most perfect examples of what a sequel should do. BioShock Infinite, then, possessing all that same potential and magic, says, no no, we're going back. We're going back to FPS proper, and we're still gonna push. But this time, we're gonna push forward. The result is a more traditional FPS game that still feels just as innovative and exciting as what came before it.\nThe story, while certainly well executed, I'll admit makes some rather... interesting, decisions at some points.
