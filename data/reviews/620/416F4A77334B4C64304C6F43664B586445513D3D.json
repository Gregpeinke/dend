If not, WHY NOT?! Anyway, this sequel to one of the internet's favourite phenomenons is a wacky trip back into the bowels of Aperture Science Labs to have some fun with science's headmistress - Glados. The story remains dark and humourous with even more lore delving deeper into Aperture's history. This game includes a variety of new gimicks to keep things fresh for the veterans, and to start things off with a bang for newcomers. The level of challenge remains the same as before, ranging from simple but fun for casual gamers to unforgiving but rewarding for hardcore gamers. WIth the introduction of multiplayer the fun truely only stops when you and your buddy's get into a fight about who messed up first, and even then you just wanna keep going. If you're looking for a pretty game, with a rich lore, amusing story, and fun puzzle-solving gameplay-- Look no further.","timestamp_created":1353715536,"timestamp_updated":1353715536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6831236","author":{"steamid":"76561198076581220","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1521491252},"language":"english","review":"clasic game making a return","timestamp_created":1353715286,"timestamp_updated":1353715286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3624632","author":{"steamid":"76561198025346709","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1506710279},"language":"english","review":"Mentaly stimulating.

A také i nejlepší hra, která byla zatím vytvořena! Není se čemu divit, hra obdržela více než 70 různých ocenění! První Portal byla zajímavá logická hra, ale byla hodně krátká, za ty 3-4 hodiny hraní, to ale stálo za to. Takže se Valve jednou rozhodlo, že udělají Portal 2 (aby i tato hra měla svoje pokračování.) Příběh vám nechci prozrazovat, protože by to zkazilo herní zážitek. Co ale můžu říct je, že ve hře opět najdete Chell, a novou postavu jménem Wheatley. Nejedná se o žádný ULTRA-VELKÝ-Příběh, který by byl stejně velký jako ten ve Final Fantasy, Epickou Akci, nebo Exploze ve stylu Michaela Baye, místo toho ve hře najdete charismatické postavy, perfektní humor, který pobaví snad každého, nebo skvěle udělané úrovně. Ve hře je také možnost hrát Kooperatovní mód, takže pokud máte přítele s kterým hrát, užijete si spoustu srandy. Hra má taky velký počet achievementů, které herní dobu zdélší. Také máte možnost vytvořit vaše úrovně, které pak můžete zveřejnit na Steam Workshop, a pak si třeba zahrát úrovně ostatních lidí. Některé jsou dobré, některé jsou těžké, některé jsou lehké, některé jsou šílené, a v některých tam někdo nic nedal. Také má hra zajímavé Easter Eggy, nebudu vám je tu ale spoilerovat.

Превосходное продолжение первой части, это - уже полноценная игра, а не тот \"пробный камень\", каким был первый Portal. Тогда разработчики только прощупывали жанр, а тут - сработали в полную силу. Своеобразная атмосфера,  неповторимый юмор и приятная глазу графика.

I have gone through this one twice, and have watched other people play it. If you haven't, play the first one before this one. Not because you really need to to understand this one to be honest, but because it has amazing dialog and I think that playing this first with all the new additions might sour the experience of the first one.\n\nThat being said, the point is mostly the same. Use a portal opening device to get around platforms and hazards and make your way to your target.\n\nInfinitely superior to the first game, this one adds a lot more mechanics to the puzzles and blows the already great comedy through the roof with the new eccentric characters it introduces.\n\nEvery line of dialog in this game is a gem. You haven't lived until you hear an eccentric quasi scientist corporate rant about life, lemons and lemonade.\n\nAlso, if you are really into the puzzle solving and you can never have enough, it supports user made scenarios, and there are even great full mods with their own stories out there.","timestamp_created":1352302087,"timestamp_updated":1647750422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6151103","author":{"steamid":"76561198060075994","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":7417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5354,"last_played":1563203092},"language":"english","review":"여태 해본 퍼즐게임중 당연 최고\r\n\r\n코옵은 친한 친구끼리 하면 좋을것 같다.","timestamp_created":1352267284,"timestamp_updated":1352267284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"609957","author":{"steamid":"76561197972939745","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":940,"last_played":1563139632},"language":"english","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1352250251,"timestamp_updated":1352250251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2285113","author":{"steamid":"76561198005162056","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1352275200},"language":"english","review":"Really a clever game.\nPerfectly done.\nA simple but original idea and a great show of the physics engine","timestamp_created":1352244057,"timestamp_updated":1352244057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5165107","author":{"steamid":"76561198045839220","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3115,"last_played":1530419372},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely fantastic game.
