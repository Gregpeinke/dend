Не смотря на то, что игре 22 года, вы будете играть в неё с удовольствием (конечно если вы не графодрочер). В этом обзоре я расскажу все минусы и плюсы данной игры, а брать её или нет, это вы решите сами. Поехали.\nПЛЮСЫ:\n1)\tЭто не плохой шутер. Начнём с того, что в игре имеется богатый запас вооружения, начиная от простого пистолета, заканчивая арбалетом и инопланетным оружием. Оно в руках у нашего главного героя ведёт себя вполне адекватно, да и в целом почти всё оружие в игре удобное, кроме мантировки, но об этом чуть позже. Оружее полностью сбалансированное, то есть ты не будешь ходить только с одной пушкой, нет, ты будешь пользоваться всем и прекрасно. Как я сказал ранее оружее удобное и за это игре плюс.\n2)\tГрафика. Буду честен графон устарел, но не полностью. Играть комфортно, всё ещё можно, но если пиксели вам режут глаза, то могу посоветовать ремастер первой части «Black Mesa». Вот там с графикой все ок. Короче, если вы к графике не строги, то играть приятно, но если вам графон не нравится, то берите ремастер.\n3)\tГлавный герой. Ну тут всё просто, вы играете за 28 летнего (если ошибся, то поправьте меня)  физика- Гордана Фримена. Этот молодой человек за всю игру не скажет не одного слова, но поверьте не смотря на это, мы привязывается к нему, сопереживаем и проходим весь этот не лёгкий путь вместе с ним. \n4)\tСюжет. ВНИМАНИЕ, СПОЛЛЕРОВ НЕТ. Весь сюжет я пересказывать не буду, захотите, пройдёте игру и сами всё узнаете. Скажем лишь то, что он интересный и захватывающий, не скажу, что он простой или сложный для понимания, после прохождения игры у вас будет чевство, что вроде ты всё понял, но частичка недосказанности всё равно есть. В общем сюжет классный, ведь не даром все так ждут продолжения.\n5)\tВраги. Они самые разнообразные, есть как простые военные, так и инопланетяне.  Они все очень умные и к каждому нужно находить свой подход. А если будете проходить игру на харде, то я вам не завидую, там вы будете бояться совершенно всех и вся, так как я уже ранее сказал, что враги умные и пипец какие сильные. А от финального босса у меня полыхало даже на минимальном уровне сложности. Подведя итоги скажу, что соперники умные, сильные, быстрые и ловкие, то есть хорошие и это плюс.\nЭто все плюсы которые я смог найти, если знаете ещё, то напишите, буду рад  почитать.\nМИНУСЫ:\nМонтировка. С этим оружием не удобно сражаться, так как нет прицела, хоть куда ты бьёшь и понятно, но она  раздрожает.\nАвто сохранения. Они убогие, в частности из за того, что не понятно где находятся. Просто, что бы вы понимали, вся игра разделена на  главы. И когда наступает новая глава игра автоматически не сохраняется, если ты умрёшь, то тебе приходится доходить до главы ещё раз. Ну это же бред, но ради справедливости можно сказать, что в игре есть ручные сохранения и это спасает ситуацию, если бы не они, то игру я врятли прошёл бы.\nОтсутствие русского языка. Это значит, что придётся скачавать русификатор, а это лишняя марока. Скажу сразу, что чуть позже к обзору я скину русификатор и инструкцию к нему, если, что то не понятно, то пишите всем помогу. \n","timestamp_created":1605094648,"timestamp_updated":1605094648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79095800","author":{"steamid":"76561198022840710","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1605093363},"language":"english","review":"Most of the gameplay hold up to this day.","timestamp_created":1605093484,"timestamp_updated":1605093484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79093239","author":{"steamid":"76561198879086187","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1266,"last_played":1605040086},"language":"turkish","review":"herkese tavsiye ederim.

am absolutely torn over this game, on one hand the story is brilliant and fun but unfortunately the gameplay does not reflect this. The set pieces where a pipe falls under your weight are im sure usually an interesting way to spice up an otherwise boring task however on those occasions where one has no health they usually end up with you dying instantly and having to reload an older save or try to glitch the game. Another huge issue is the checkpoint system, it sometimes does not bother to save for hour long stretches which have led to me having to redo boss fights from the beginning. I am not sure if these are due to my system being linux however i would have expected valve to correctly port their game. I do understand that this is an old game however my experience of games of a similar age have not been as bad as this. I have marked this review as yes i would recommend as i would as this is by far not a bad game, however i would recommend this only those who are willing to be slightly dissapointed, especially if you have played half life 2 which is far better.","timestamp_created":1604949988,"timestamp_updated":1604949988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79011335","author":{"steamid":"76561198888881428","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1650967877},"language":"french","review":"Half-Life est un FPS développé par Valve et sortie en 1998 très bien réalisé pour l'époque.
