There will be new enemies in new areas, but you will still end up shooting at the same enemies at least 100 times.\nA few areas are cool, but then they are so short that they quickly die out in the vastness of boring linear level design that is the entire rest of the game.\nThe story isn't good either and as there is almost no progression it stays dull.\n\nThe controls are also flawed as there is auto aim ( fuck that crap ) and jumping mechanics are also incredibly static, so just jumping up a ledge is a pain in the ass.\nThe game also introduces a cool item, which is the long jump module, too bad you only get the one cool feature that could make the game at least somewhat interesting incredibly late.\n\nAll in all. It might have been good in the past, but it's probably so outdated that even CoD is more enjoyable than this and no I'm not a fucking CoD fanboy.","timestamp_created":1495800434,"timestamp_updated":1495800434,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.345930516719818115","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31965621","author":{"steamid":"76561198262214421","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":212,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1660522098},"language":"spanish","review":"¿De que seria ahora VALVe sin Half-Life?\n\n¿A ver diganme que seria ahora? c:\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10 Soporte para los mods de la comunidad, revolucionó la industria, Counter-Strike, y bla bla bla.\n\n\n[spoiler]No es por nada GabeN pero... ¿no cree que deberia hacer algo en su 20° aniversario?.

Да, за почти 20 лет существования Half-Life, я так ни разу в неё и не играл.\n\nОчень понравилось, но в контексте современности некоторые элементы смотрятся странно, даже устаревшими, но тем не менее. \n\nВ первую очередь хочу отметить, что это игра о геймплейном разнообразии. Большое количество оружия, врагов, игровых ситуаций. Авторы ловко жонглируют всем, что они создали. Экшн сцены сменяются головоломками, головоломки - прыжковыми упражнениями по висящими над пропастью ящиками, затем ты едешь на вагонетке, плаваешь в затопленных помещениях, сражаешься с невидимками и тд. Элементы геймплея меняются, комбинируются и не дают скучать. Условия  преображаются и приходится адаптироваться под новые правила. И это всё действительно классно и гармонично работает, я не могу припомнить подобного разнообразия, построенного по сути на одной механике, ни в одной игре. Это действительно шедеврально сделано.\n\nК сожалению, под конец игры концепция меняющегося геймплея доходит до абсолюта в виде мира Зен. Совершенно другие условия слегка отпугнули меня и потребовалось время, чтоб допройти до конца. Но это мелочь, скорее некий субъективизм.\n\nОстальные же элементы уже выгляд более устаревшими и спорными. Графика очевидно режет глаза, но я спустя минут 15 привык. Так и не понял, как работает музыка, большую часть времени мы бегаем в тишине, лишь иногда включаются некоторые треки. Звуки проработаны хорошо, но ничего особеннного. То же можно сказать и про сюжет: ничего особенного. Он тут для такого жанра неплох, но восторга не вызывает.\n\nПроходил сразу на максимальной сложности, всё достаточно сбалансированно. В итоге получается не лёгкая пробежка, но и умирать по 50 раз на одном месте не придётся, приходится быть внимательным и сконцентрированным.\n\nНарвался на пару багов, когда Гордон, посещая угол, просто там застревает и не хочет никуда идти. Наверное, какая-нибудь психологическая травма из детства)\n\nПодводя итоги: шедевр своего времени и сейчас смотрится и играется неплохо. Но советовать его всем не могу, слишком большой возраст у игры, не все, так скажем, смогут адаптироваться под изменившиеся условия) Но кто сможет, тот будет вознагражден великоленым геймплеем.\n\nБез сомнения добавляю в \"Избранное\")","timestamp_created":1494840719,"timestamp_updated":1500226411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625861823558807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31764856","author":{"steamid":"76561198199898429","num_games_owned":1000,"num_reviews":189,"playtime_forever":8444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1656885269},"language":"english","review":"It gud","timestamp_created":1494838267,"timestamp_updated":1640210574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31764465","author":{"steamid":"76561197979686200","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1485880247},"language":"english","review":"Looking for nostalgia and, possibly, a challenge (in comparison to HL2 anyway)? \n\nHere you go.
