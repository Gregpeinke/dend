Probably since I played the first BioShock to be honest.  I jumped into Infinite not expecting anything, and I will admit, it's one of the better choices I've made going into a game.  I love the first two BioShock's, I dived into the lore, got used to the gameplay mechanics and overall felt good about my investment into the series.  Then I played Infinite; my mind was blown from the very first second!  Let me talk about why Infinite climbed it's way up to my favourite BioShock game and one of my favourite FPS games of all time.\n\nYes, as somebody who played the other two first, I am aware of the many changes Infinite has made.  From gameplay changes to being in the sky instead of the sea; I understand alot of fans were disapointed by this.  Me, I was happy with the changes.  Gunfights are now super climactic and allow for you to pull off badass moves and use  [strike]plasmids[/strike] \"Vigors\" quickly, (gotta get used to that).  Simply walking around, enjoying the impressive graphics and just listeng to Elizabeth speak would make a great game on it's own.  The narrative is amazing and instead of having one major turning point 3/4 into the game like the first one, everything seems new and unexpected, which i love!  Booker and Elizabeth's friendship go through ups and downs and it's nice to see realistic conversations throughout the game.  \n\nWhat more can I say about it?  Gameplay is deep and exciting and the story is complex and interesting.  I'm going to give this game a perfect 10!  As much as I look for flaws; I can't seem to find any.  Sure, it's not \"BioShock\" according to the fans, but as a first-person shooter, it's everything i'm looking for in one package.  Enjoy.\n\n[h1]10/10[/h1]\n(PS:  The ending is just \"Perfect\"  Trust
