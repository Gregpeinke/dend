An expansion for the already revolutionary Half-Life following a new protagonist, Adrian Shepherd. Opposing Force introduces new gameplay elements such as new weapons, a grappling hook, squad interactions which was later inplemented to Half-Life 2, etc. Story was a focus on the marines' perspective during the events of Half-Life. Also got more hints and story to the mysterious G-man in the last game. Definitely a must play if you enjoyed the original Half Life.\n\nSome annoying issues with the game is the glitches, dated AI, and crashes, but we can all ignore that. \n\nThanks to Half-Life Opposing force, it helped kickstarted Gearbox Software that later gave us Borderlands Series but sadly, Borderlands and a few other titles were really excellent games and other titles such as Duke Nukem Forever, Aliens: Colonel Marines, Battleborn were quite crappy.  Finally Valve is taking development to Half-Life: Alyx which hopefully would bring Half-Life series back from the dead, and hopefully we could see a future story with Adrian Shepherd.\n\n\nEdit 18/05/2020\nValve released Half-Life:Alyx, if Half-Life 3 were to ever be released, Valve stated themselves they want it to revolutionize the video game industry so we all have to be patient.","timestamp_created":1574912186,"timestamp_updated":1589834392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625433862209320068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58333841","author":{"steamid":"76561198400403494","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1654194537},"language":"english","review":"It's good","timestamp_created":1574906578,"timestamp_updated":1574906578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58333613","author":{"steamid":"76561198343787395","num_games_owned":873,"num_reviews":340,"playtime_forever":402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1520391138},"language":"english","review":"season pass","timestamp_created":1574906441,"timestamp_updated":1574906441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58324947","author":{"steamid":"76561198239956334","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":461,"last_played":1604205655},"language":"english","review":"what the actual fuck are these enemies","timestamp_created":1574901669,"timestamp_updated":1574901669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58298331","author":{"steamid":"76561198228110336","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1574889788},"language":"english","review":"The best side story to any game I've ever played!","timestamp_created":1574889815,"timestamp_updated":1574889815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58282279","author":{"steamid":"76561198136641481","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1618935711},"language":"english","review":"yay","timestamp_created":1574884915,"timestamp_updated":1574884915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58275145","author":{"steamid":"76561198137702014","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1571922632},"language":"czech","review":"První datadisk do původní hry Half life.

juego en si esta demasiado bien, incluso en cierto aspecto mejor que la primera entrega de Half life, aunque este sea menos extenso que la primera entrega, siento que refresca toda la jugabilidad de este, en cuanto al uso de armas, plataformas, objetos, y más, el estilo lineal del Mapeo me parece bueno, aunque recicla algo de lo que tenia el titulo Naranjo anterior, lo malo, es cuando uno va entrar a otra zona despues de la pantalla de carga, lamentablemente el personaje se queda quieto, y no puedo moverme a menos que reinicie el nivel en \"Save Game\" y es una lástima ya que quiero jugar sin ese tipo de interrupciones, no sé si es un error por ser una nueva versión o compatibilidad con el juego, pero fuera de eso esta realmente bien, a mi me gusta mucho Half life tanto como el original como sus expansiones, pero debo reconocer que a pesar de que opposing force no es un juego creado directamente de Valve, me gusta mas que el titulo original, aunque digo que igual estan como
