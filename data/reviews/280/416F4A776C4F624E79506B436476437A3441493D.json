Nice clear visuals\n2. Water looks extremely amazing\n3. Great Vistas\n4. You can skip the \"We've Got Hostiles\" chapter by hitting the scientist with the crowbar\n5. Weapons are so satisfying to use in this game\n6. It has 3D skyboxes which look great (Not all of them)\n7. The Title screen looks so cool when you open up the game\n8. Flashlight looks better\n9. Realistic shadows when you see NPCs\n\nCons:\n1. Weapons look super shiny which are annoying\n2. You cannot kill helicopters with the Tau Cannon or the RPG properly\n3. When you first get the RPG and then try to kill the helicopter, it doesn't work!!! The RPG is extremely messed up in this game. (As well as the Tau cannon)\n4. The Marines kill you so quickly because SMGs now do way more damage for some reason.\n5. It is impossible to get through these encounters without significant damage.\n6. IT IS LITERALLY THE ORIGINAL GAME PORTED ON THE SOURCE ENGINE!!!!!!!\n7. It is completely useless because a better remake of Half-Life 1 came out called \"Black Mesa\" (which I have played before)\n8. Skyboxes start to spaz out when you are in the chapter \"Surface Tension\"\n9. Those big tentacles in the chapter \"Blast Pit\" can't even hurt you, making you put no effort at all in the chapter.\n10. The \"Gonarch's Lair\" chapter is completely broken. The Gonarch does not attack you at all and just sits there like a lazy bastard. The Gonarch is also immune to rocket damage but is not immune to the Gluon gun that you have. It will just mostly fire that poison acid out of her ass. And to make matters worse, shooting acid will leave an ugly, stupid black square on the floor as a decal.

The game itself is a pretty good puzzle/shooter with a few hiccups in the game's flow but overall it is a fine game. \n\nThis specific version of the game has graphical glitches that are pretty annoying when you get them and the game itself is not much of an upgrade from the original. There are some upgrades to this game that the original half life doesn't have but not by much, since all of the textures are pretty much the same and the game still looks highly outdated. Either play the original or Black Mesa since that game sounds good.","timestamp_created":1621954089,"timestamp_updated":1622479047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519125699996948242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92552623","author":{"steamid":"76561198169721107","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1534635666},"language":"spanish","review":"Un clásico, por la historia que tiene haz de darle la oportunidad al menos de probarlo, de los que hay que jugar al menos una vez en la vida","timestamp_created":1621913051,"timestamp_updated":1621913051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92545085","author":{"steamid":"76561199013563883","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1617589506},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy this game.
