The more I wrote, however; the more I realized that I DON'T recommend this game.  As a game it's not bad; it's even pretty good.  There are several issues that make me not recommend it. First was the ham-fisted moralizing of the game, which could be summed up as \"America is racist, diversity is our strength, borders are bad, and religion probably is, too\".  This, in and of itself could have been tolerated, but the fact that it got to the level of sermonizing at times, just made it grating.  I also kind of hated the ridiculous multiverse nonsense. The final issue was the fact that none of the characters actually managed to rise to the level of being interesting enough for me to remember them.  All in all, I enjoyed playing it, but was not a fan of the story or characters.  I can't really recommend this, because there are any number of decent FPS's out there to spend your money on.

It's just a gross attempt to market the nostalgia and success of the original bioshocks. This game would be 100% acceptable and a solid two thumbs up if it wasn't trying to bait you into thinking this was a continuation of the franchise. There's only one DLC which supposedly ties in to old Rapture but also retcons the base Inifinity story ending... so many contradictions and lack of features trying to take us for a joyride.

Now I cannot express how wrong I was. In fact, the story in this game breaks it in the most original way I have ever experienced.\n\nLet's start from the main protagonist. In Jungian's palette of archetypes, Booker takes a role of Hero, who has to rescue the Innocent - Elizabeth, but quickly gains another one, which defines the whole conflict and leads to unexpected outcome. After introducing Comstock, main antagonist wielding powerful combo of the Ruler, Sage and Magician, Booker gains a mark of the False Shepherd and becomes his counterweight, like reversed card in Tarot. But the authors didn't end up yet. Throughout his journey we can even taste the impression of becoming Explorer and the Rebel, two another powerful archetypes. Elizabeth's figure in this story is not left behind. We learn quickly that she is also an Orphan and later she transforms into the Creator, thanks to her extraordinary abilities. This shapeshifting and juggling archetypes proves that characters in this game are not only dynamic, but more human, because people's mind is not so stable as we tend to think and it can be easily shaken by unexpected event. The title 'Infinite' is also interesting, especially after reaching the ending, as it suggests that this 'Hero's Journey', the whole cycle of death and reborn will last forever like Saṃsāra, or at least until we truly die along with our whole hidden personalities and consciousness and achieve Nirvana, often described as total emptiness.\n\nAnd so with emptiness I was left after finishing this game, with hands shaken and jaw dropped. Of course there are a lot more interpretations, such as projection of Booker's suffering mind after losing someone important in his life or the reference to Hawking's theory of infite worlds. I consider this my favourite game and the best one I have ever played, because it touches gently the nature of humanity, reaches deeply to the core of any relligion while offering relaxing gameplay, pleasurable shooting experience and breathtaking visuals.","timestamp_created":1602873637,"timestamp_updated":1639857601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486111104488372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77659678","author":{"steamid":"76561199065873303","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1602870300},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1602870614,"timestamp_updated":1602870614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77659579","author":{"steamid":"76561198084399657","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4023,"last_played":1644627849},"language":"english","review":"l","timestamp_created":1602870482,"timestamp_updated":1602870482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77658927","author":{"steamid":"76561198829206146","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1602600021},"language":"turkish","review":"çok iyi aq","timestamp_created":1602869674,"timestamp_updated":1602869674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77658161","author":{"steamid":"76561198064540490","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1603216294},"language":"english","review":"cool game","timestamp_created":1602868824,"timestamp_updated":1602868824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77656756","author":{"steamid":"76561198115746130","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1486,"last_played":1602862895},"language":"english","review":"6/10\n\nWhy can i have only 2 guns?! It makes the whole weapon upgrade system useless and to top it of, their look doesn't change with upgrades like in the 1st one, even though that was like the best thing in any videogame ever. Some levels were meh, and the level with a dead witch lady suck fuckin dick, dirty fuckin foreskin fucker, I ain't ever playing that level again cause I'd have to shoot myself in the head with my upgraded shotgun but oh no, what's that? I can't do it cause it's not lying around at this moment and im in a sniper level so i gotta use sniper rifle anyway! Many people said that previous games were much better in atmosphere cause of their less narrative nature, and i agree with em. I can't say i hated it or was perticulary dissapointed, i still enjoyed it for what it was, but i can see how negatively that affects replayability. And the lack of choice in approaching the levels just sucks kinda, it's more of a laid back style gameplay, where you just kinda sit back, watch beautiful sceneries, listen to interesting story, and kill a bunch of people here and there. If you play the game with this in mind, then it's enjoyable for what it is, but you'll just be dissapointed if you expect another bioshock experience, which i think was better. Nontheless, i still enjoyed it for what it is, but i don't really see myself replaying it any time soon. The story that is higly praised for being heartbreaking and emotionally heavy, was from my point of view very interesting and it was a nice ride, but not hearbreaking nor emotionally heavy. I feel like it was a nice complicated puzzle that was slowly coming together, and it was fun to watch cause it was pretty interesting and unique in it's way, but that's it. I am a man of heart and soul, some games aren't pretty but have great heart, and some games are gorgeous, but don't have much heart and empathy to them. That's bioshock infinite. I'm not saying that it's bad, I think that it's a beautiful game, with fun laid back FPS gameplay and a very interesting pretty story. But that's it. Fun ride I enjoyed, but nothing more, hope you understand what i mean with that. And also fuck that fuckin witch level nigga seriously man, anyone who is responsible for that atrocious level should be devoured alive by a fuckin aligator. AND also, DLCs are equally good as the base game and it's a nice change of gameplay mechanics for a while with some more interesting cool story so if you enjoyed the game i recommend them as well.
